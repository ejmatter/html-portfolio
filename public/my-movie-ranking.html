 <h1>The Best Movies According to Elijah</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies.</h2>
 
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
 <p>This was one of the best ensemble movies that was built upon a decade of movies.
    This could have been an over bloated movie but it was actually prety succint and 
    allowed for each character to shine.

 <h3>Lilo and Stich</h3>
 <p>
    This is one of my favoite Disney movies, it is very cute and shows how 
    family may drive us craay but will always be there for us and help us grow.
</p>
 <h3>Men In Black</h3>
 <p>
    This is one of the first sci-fi movies that I remember seeing as a child. 
    Men in Black is funny and has a thrilling story,  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones 
    are the perfect odd couple pairing.
